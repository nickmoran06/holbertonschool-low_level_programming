# :colombia: C - Binary trees
- What is a binary tree
- What is the difference between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree
- What is the possible gain in terms of time complexity compared to linked lists
- What are the depth, the height, the size of a binary tree
- What are the different traversal methods to go through a binary tree
- What is a complete, a full, a perfect, a balanced binary tree
## Prerequisites
Language C and compiler gcc with fhe flags:
                                                                             
gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic                                             
## Installing
For have the code in your local machine you only need download the code files and put it into a directory.
## Built With
gcc 4.8.4 and ubuntu 14.04
